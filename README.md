#Get to Know Sean

##Approach Taken**

This is my first project in General Assembly's WDI program. I wanted to create a game that is interactive to share some of my background.

-As a user, I should be able start the game, which begins with a question.

-The user will have the option of guessing the answer. If correct, the flashcard will flip and reveal the correct answer.

-If the user gets tired of guessing and just want to know the answer, you can just flip the card to view the answer.

-If the user wants to add another card to the deck. they can click the add button to do so.

-When all the cards in the deck is used, the game will be considered complete.


##Technologies Used

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JQuery

##Installation Instruction

This project can be viewed on any Web Broswer.

##Unsolved Problems

-I wanted to create a form that will open to add new card. The form should have a place for both question and answer. I didn't get a chance to figure this out.

-I wanted to separate the missed cards to go back to at the end of the game.
